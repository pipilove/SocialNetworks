gowalla-exp
===========

The trajectory based analysis and experiment on gowalla dataset.


# Background

This Gowalla-centered experiment is one example of using geographical data to infer the social strength between users. One beauty of this dataset is that it provides the on-line social networks which can serve as a ground truth of the friendship relation.


# File Structure

My simulation codes follow my personal consistent style.

* src -- all java simulation program
* matlab -- all matlab plotting scripts
* python -- all intermediate date process scritps
* sqlscirpts -- (deprecated) at the beginning of the simulator coding, I plan to use the MySQL database. But later I abandon this idea.
* img -- (deprecated) some png image generated by Java
* all the other folds and txt files contain intermediate simulation results


# Project Wiki

Now this project has a [wiki page](https://github.com/thekingofkings/gowalla-exp/wiki). It explains the functionality of each components, and gives a walkthrough to replicate the experiment results.
